<h3>BetterInformatics Drive Shutdown</h3>
<p>
    BetterInformatics Google Drive is shutting down in spring 2024.
</p>
<p>
    Please migrate any files that you find useful on the Drive to
    BetterInformatics File Collection:
    <a href="https://files.betterinformatics.com">files.betterinformatics.com</a>
</p>
<div id="only-show-if-trying-to-access-item">
    <p>
        With that in mind, you can still access the files you're after <a id="temp-drive-link" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=">here</a>.
        <br />
        Individual files should be publicly accessible without Google sign-in.
        Contact admins if you have any issues.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="only-show-if-trying-to-access-root-folder" style="display:none">
    <p>
        With that in mind, you can still access the Drive to view or migrate old
        documents. As a technical limitation of the Google Drive, you must go
        through a manual registration process (this is one of the reasons we are
        no longer using Drive), please email
        <a href="mailto:admin@betterinformatics.com">admin@betterinformatics.com</a> following these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>write "Better Informatics: please add me as a contributor to Google Drive" as your subject,</li>
        <li>send the email from your university email address, so we know you are a student, and</li>
        <li>include the email address of your Google account, so that you actually get access to the Drive.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once you are a member, please <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA">
            click here to access the Shared Drive
        </a>.
    </p>

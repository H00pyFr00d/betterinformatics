    <h3>Redirecting...</h3>
    <p>
        Due to exam season peak, we now allow read-only public nonrestricted access to items in the BetterInformatics drive. <br>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=" id="temp-drive-link">
            Click here if you are not redirected automatically.
        </a>
    </p>
</div>
<div id="only-show-if-trying-to-access-root-folder" style="display:none">
    
    <p>
        Due to high exam season, we have made each subfolder within the drive available publicly as read-only,
        so if you are looking for existing resources, <b>you can temporarily access all links on BetterInformatics.com
        without becoming a member</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to access the root folder, or collaborate your own additions to the Shared Drive, you will need
        to become a member of the drive. Usually, we can do this automatically but our CoSign (DICE login) server
        is down right now, which means we need to manually process your membership requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are a member, please <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA">
            click here to access the Shared Drive
        </a>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If you want collaborator (read/write) access to BetterInformatics' Team Drive, please email
            <a href="mailto:admin@betterinformatics.com">admin@betterinformatics.com</a> and ask for access. Make sure you:

            <ol>
                <li>write "Better Informatics: please add me as a contributor to Google Drive" as your subject,</li>
                <li>send the email from your university email address, so we know you are a student, and</li>
                <li>include the email address of your Google account, so that you actually get access to the Drive.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

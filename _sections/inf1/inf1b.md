**About the exam**

* The exam is 2 hours. It used to be 3 hours in previous years. They will not pressure you for time, don't worry.
* There is a mock exam in week 11.
* All code must compile for ANY credit at all. If you miss a single semicolon, you get 0 marks. Trip-check if it compiles and is the right file before submitting!
* Your code must also pass the very basic tests (JUnit tests, these will be provided in the exam for you to check) to get any credit at all.
